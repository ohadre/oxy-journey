# Oxy Journey - Session Log

## Overview
This document tracks all "Vibe Sessions" for the Oxy Journey project, maintaining context and progress between development sessions.

## 2024-03-19 Oxy Movement and Visual Representation Planning

- **Movement Constraints:**
  - Identified need for proper boundary constraints within tunnel
  - Current implementation allows Oxy to move outside tunnel boundaries
  - Planning collision detection system with tunnel walls
  - Considering smooth movement restrictions and visual feedback

- **Visual Representation:**
  - Evaluating options for Oxy's visual design:
    - Particle system (representing oxygen molecules)
    - 3D model (character-based approach)
    - Stylized shape (simple but effective)
  - Need to ensure visibility against tunnel background
  - Planning movement animations and effects

- **Next Actions:**
  - Implement collision detection system
  - Design and prototype Oxy's visual representation
  - Add movement constraints and feedback
  - Test and refine movement mechanics

## 2024-03-19 Project Migration and Infrastructure Setup

- **Project Structure:**
  - Migrated codebase from `next-app` directory to root folder
  - Established proper Next.js project structure with `src` directory
  - Set up essential configuration files (next.config.ts, tsconfig.json, etc.)

- **Dependencies and Configuration:**
  - Updated package.json with correct dependencies
  - Configured Tailwind CSS with proper PostCSS integration
  - Added necessary type definitions for Next.js and TypeScript
  - Set up testing environment with Jest and React Testing Library

- **Component Migration:**
  - Successfully moved all components to `src/components`
  - Implemented proper client-side rendering for 3D components
  - Fixed TypeScript errors in components
  - Resolved hydration issues with dynamic imports

- **Recent Fixes:**
  - Resolved `TypeError` in `Oxy.tsx` related to `getKeys` function
  - Fixed Tailwind CSS configuration issues
  - Updated PostCSS configuration to use `@tailwindcss/postcss`
  - Implemented proper type definitions for Next.js

- **Next Steps:**
  - Complete testing suite implementation
  - Add documentation for component usage
  - Implement remaining features
  - Optimize performance
  - Add error boundaries and logging

## 2024-06-10 Tunnel Visual & Technical Enhancements

- **Tunnel texture:** Applied seamless custom texture (`tunnel_tile.png`) to the tunnel interior using Three.js CylinderGeometry and meshStandardMaterial.
- **Texture tiling:** Set repeat to (4, 2) for a natural, non-stretched look.
- **Texture animation:** Animated the texture's offset (offset.y) each frame to simulate forward movement through the tunnel (`useFrame` with `texture.offset.y += delta * 0.2`).
- **Lighting:** Added a warm directional light at the tunnel entrance (`#ffd9a0`), a cool rim light at the exit (`#a0c8ff`), and ambient light for depth and realism.
- **Parameters:** All key parameters (radius, height, tiling, animation speed, light colors/intensities) are now easily adjustable for further tuning.
- **Result:** Tunnel is now immersive, dynamic, and visually clear, ready for further gameplay and visual enhancements.

## 2024-03-19 Tunnel Boundary Debugging and Oxy Movement Fixes

- Debugged Oxy's movement and tunnel boundary logic
- Confirmed tunnel geometry: radius 6, length 300 (z = -150 to +150)
- Updated Oxy's logic to strictly clamp to tunnel's cross-section and Z range
- Added a green debug wireframe for visual alignment, then removed it after confirming correct behavior
- Verified Oxy cannot escape the tunnel in any direction
- Kept Oxy as a 2D circle for now

## 2024-06-10 GitHub & Branch Protection Setup

- **Repository Setup:**
  - Initialized GitHub repository and pushed all project files.
  - Created `.gitignore` and committed initial codebase.
  - Switched default branch from `master` to `main` for modern best practices.
- **GitHub Actions:**
  - Added a workflow for automated testing on push and PR to `main`.
  - Triggered workflow with a dummy commit to register status checks.
- **Branch Protection:**
  - Configured branch protection rule for `main`.
  - Required status checks to pass before merging.
  - Required branches to be up to date before merging.
  - Confirmed rule is active and targets the correct branch.

## 2024-03-19 GitHub Actions Workflow Trigger

- **Triggered GitHub Actions Workflow:**
  - Executed `git push` command to trigger the GitHub Actions workflow for status check registration.

## 2024-06-10 Oxy Character Visual & Movement Update

- **Oxy Visual Update:**
  - Replaced placeholder circle with a sprite using `oxy.png` image (located in `public/textures/`).
  - Ensured Oxy always faces the camera for clarity.
- **Movement Fix:**
  - Updated movement logic to use the correct mesh reference (`meshRef.current`), restoring keyboard controls.
  - Confirmed Oxy moves as expected in the tunnel.
- **Next:**
  - Proceeding to Vercel deployment and integration.
