## 2024-06-10 Tunnel Visual & Technical Enhancements

- **Tunnel texture:** Applied seamless custom texture (`tunnel_tile.png`) to the tunnel interior using Three.js CylinderGeometry and meshStandardMaterial.
- **Texture tiling:** Set repeat to (4, 2) for a natural, non-stretched look.
- **Texture animation:** Animated the texture's offset (offset.y) each frame to simulate forward movement through the tunnel (`useFrame` with `texture.offset.y += delta * 0.2`).
- **Lighting:** Added a warm directional light at the tunnel entrance (`#ffd9a0`), a cool rim light at the exit (`#a0c8ff`), and ambient light for depth and realism.
- **Parameters:** All key parameters (radius, height, tiling, animation speed, light colors/intensities) are now easily adjustable for further tuning.
- **Result:** Tunnel is now immersive, dynamic, and visually clear, ready for further gameplay and visual enhancements.

## 2024-03-19 Tunnel Boundary Debugging and Oxy Movement Fixes

- Debugged Oxy's movement and tunnel boundary logic

- Updated Oxy's logic to strictly clamp to tunnel's cross-section and Z range
- Added a green debug wireframe for visual alignment, then removed it after confirming correct behavior
- Verified Oxy cannot escape the tunnel in any direction
- Kept Oxy as a 2D circle for now

## 2024-06-11 Entity System & Collision Refactor

- **Goal:** Implement robust collision detection and refactor entity (Germs, Dust) management for better state control, separation of concerns, and continuous gameplay flow.

- **Key Changes & Implementations:**
    - **State Centralization (`Scene3D.tsx`):**
        - Managed `germs`, `dustParticles`, and `lives` state.
        - Implemented `handleGermsChange`, `handleDustChange`, `handleCollision` callbacks.
    - **Logic-Only Managers (`GermManager.tsx`, `DustManager.tsx`):
        - Refactored to handle all entity logic (movement, spawning, filtering based on lifetime/bounds) without direct rendering.
        - Adjusted movement algorithms to prevent visual snapping and ensure smooth progression.
        - Tuned spawning parameters (`MAX_GERMS`, `MAX_DUST`, `SPAWN_INTERVAL`, speeds, lifetimes) after multiple iterations to achieve a continuous flow of entities.
    - **Visual Components (`Germ.tsx`, `DustParticle.tsx`):
        - `Germ.tsx` updated to be purely visual.
        - New `DustParticle.tsx` created for rendering dust as textured, camera-facing planes.
    - **Collision System (`CollisionManager.tsx`):
        - Now checks for collisions between Oxy and both Germ and Dust entities.
        - Uses simple radius-based overlap detection.
        - Reports collision type (`'germ'` or `'dust'`) and entity `id` to `Scene3D`.
        - `handleCollision` in `Scene3D` updated to decrement `lives` and remove the correct entity from state.
    - **UI (`LivesIndicator.tsx`):
        - Connected to `lives` state in `Scene3D` to accurately reflect player health.

- **Debugging & Iteration:**
    - Addressed initial visual bugs where entities would snap to their target Z position.
    - Iteratively tuned entity spawning limits and rates to ensure a consistent presence of obstacles.
    - Resolved build errors related to prop mismatches and duplicate component instantiations.

- **Outcome:**
    - Core entity management and collision detection systems are now robust and data-driven.
    - Player lives are correctly impacted by collisions.
    - The game provides a more continuous and predictable challenge regarding obstacles.
    - Architecture documentation (`02_architecture_overview.md`) updated to reflect these changes.

## 2025-05-12 Q&A System - Initial Setup & Localization

- **Goal:** Begin implementation of the Q&A system, focusing on data structure, localization, and initial fetching.
- **Key Decisions & Refinements:**
    - Questions will be stored in `public/data/questions.json`.
    - Support for multiple question types: multiple-choice, yes/no, open-question (AI review is future scope).
    - Questions trigger on collision with germs/dust (future implementation detail).
    - Do not show questions already answered correctly (resets per game session).
    - Each question has a topic (e.g., "Lungs", "Breathing Mechanics").
    - If all unique questions are answered, they can repeat.
- **Implementation Steps & Outcome:**
    - **1. Type Definitions (`src/types/question.types.ts`):**
        - Defined `LanguageCode` ('en', 'he').
        - Defined `LocalizedText` for i18n string fields.
        - Defined `LocalizedAnswerOption` for i18n answer options.
        - Defined `Question` (raw structure from JSON) and `DisplayQuestion` (resolved for current language).
    - **2. Sample Questions (`public/data/questions.json`):**
        - Created with sample questions in English and Hebrew, covering multiple-choice, yes/no, and open-question types.
        - Included localized text for questions, options, and explanations.
    - **3. Question Service (`src/lib/questionService.ts`):**
        - Implemented `fetchAndResolveQuestions(lang: LanguageCode)` function.
        - Fetches `questions.json`, parses it, and resolves all `LocalizedText` fields to the specified language.
        - Handles potential mixed old/new question structures for backward compatibility during development.
    - **4. Initial Testing (`src/pages/question-test.tsx`):
        - Created a temporary page to test `questionService`.
        - Fetched and displayed questions in both English and Hebrew.
        - Resolved a visual bug (black text on black) by adding `color: '#FFF'`.
        - Confirmed successful loading and localization of questions.
    - **5. Development Journal & Commit:**
        - Updated `docs_ai/session_log.md` with progress.
        - Committed changes with "feat(qa): Initial Q&A system setup with localization".

## 2025-05-12 Q&A System - Core State Management in Scene3D

- **Goal:** Implement core Q&A state variables and initial question loading logic within `Scene3D.tsx`.
- **Sub-tasks Completed:**
    - **2.1 Add Q&A state variables:**
        - Added `allQuestions: DisplayQuestion[]`, `currentLanguage: LanguageCode` (default 'en'), `answeredCorrectlyIds: string[]`, `currentDisplayQuestion: DisplayQuestion | null`, `isModalVisible: boolean`, `isLoadingQuestions: boolean`, `questionError: string | null` to `Scene3D.tsx` state.
    - **2.2 Implement initial question loading:**
        - Used `useEffect` to call `fetchAndResolveQuestions` on component mount and when `currentLanguage` changes.
        - Handled loading and error states (`isLoadingQuestions`, `questionError`).
        - Added console logs for verification. Loading was successful, showing "Questions loaded: 4".
    - **2.3 Implement basic Q&A reset logic:**
        - Created `startNewQASession` function to reset `answeredCorrectlyIds`, `currentDisplayQuestion`, and `isModalVisible`.
        - Added a temporary "Reset Q&A Session (Test)" button to trigger this function.
        - Test was successful, confirmed by console logs showing state reset.
- **Cleanup & Commit:**
    - Removed temporary test button and loading status UI from `Scene3D.tsx`.
    - Updated `docs_ai/session_log.md`.
    - Committed changes with "feat(qa): Implement Q&A state management and loading in Scene3D".

## 2025-05-12 Q&A System - QuestionModal UI & Basic Integration

- **Goal:** Develop the `QuestionModal.tsx` UI component and integrate it into `Scene3D.tsx` for basic display and interaction.
- **Sub-tasks Completed:**
    - **3.1 Develop `QuestionModal.tsx` UI Component:**
        - Created `src/components/ui/QuestionModal.tsx`.
        - Props: `question: DisplayQuestion | null`, `isVisible: boolean`, `onAnswer`, `onClose`.
        - Renders different UI for `multiple-choice`, `yes-no` (combined), and `open-question` types using Tailwind CSS.
        - For open questions: added local `useState` for `openInputText`, made textarea controlled, and ensured input clears on modal visibility/question change.
        - Added a submit button for open questions, disabled if input is empty.
    - **3.2 Integrate `QuestionModal` into `Scene3D.tsx`:**
        - Imported `QuestionModal` into `Scene3D.tsx`.
        - Implemented `handleAnswer` and `handleCloseModal` callback functions in `Scene3D.tsx`. These functions log details, hide the modal, clear `currentDisplayQuestion`, and set `gameState` to 'playing'.
        - Rendered `QuestionModal` within `Scene3D.tsx`, passing necessary props.
        - Added a temporary "Show Test Question Modal" button in `Scene3D.tsx` to set a random question from `allQuestions` to `currentDisplayQuestion`, set `isModalVisible` to true, and `gameState` to 'question_paused'.
    - **UI Test & Cleanup:**
        - Successfully tested the modal display and basic interaction (answering, closing).
        - Console logs confirmed correct state changes and data flow.
        - Removed the temporary "Show Test Question Modal" button from `Scene3D.tsx` after successful testing.
- **Next Steps:**
    - Implement logic for triggering the modal on collision.
    - Implement actual answer checking and progression logic.
    - Persist `answeredCorrectlyIds` and filter questions accordingly.

## 2025-05-12 Q&A System - Trigger Q&A Modal on Collision

- **Goal:** Modify `Scene3D.tsx` to trigger the Q&A modal when Oxy collides with a germ or dust particle.
- **Implementation Steps:**
    - Updated the `handleCollision` callback in `Scene3D.tsx`:
        - Added a guard to ensure Q&A is only triggered if `gameState` is 'playing'. If a collision occurs while `gameState` is 'question_paused' (i.e., modal is already active), the entity is still removed, but a new question is not triggered.
        - The collided entity (germ or dust) is now removed from its respective state array (`germs` or `dustParticles`) immediately upon collision.
        - Implemented question selection logic:
            - Filters `allQuestions` to get questions not present in `answeredCorrectlyIds`.
            - If no unanswered questions are found, `answeredCorrectlyIds` is reset to an empty array (to allow questions to repeat, as per requirements), and all questions become available again.
            - A random question is selected from the available pool.
            - If no questions are loaded at all (`allQuestions` is empty), a warning is logged, and no question is shown.
        - If a question is selected, `currentDisplayQuestion` is set, `isModalVisible` is set to `true`, and `gameState` is changed to 'question_paused'.
    - Updated the dependency array for `useCallback` in `handleCollision` to include `gameState`, `allQuestions`, and `answeredCorrectlyIds`.
- **Testing & Debugging:**
    - Initial tests showed no visual change on collision. Console logs indicated an outdated version of `handleCollision` was running.
    - Re-applied the `edit_file` operation for `Scene3D.tsx`.
    - After restarting the dev server and hard-refreshing the browser, subsequent tests were successful:
        - Collision correctly triggered the display of the `QuestionModal`.
        - Console logs confirmed the new `handleCollision` logic was executing, including correct `gameState` reporting, entity removal (though visual confirmation was difficult due to speed), question selection, and `gameState` change to 'question_paused'.
        - The guard for `gameState !== 'playing'` was also confirmed to be working, preventing multiple modals from simultaneous collisions or collisions while a question was active.
- **Next Steps:**
    - Implement actual answer checking and progression logic within the `handleAnswer` callback in `Scene3D.tsx`.
    - Update `answeredCorrectlyIds` based on correct answers.
    - Determine how lives are affected by question outcomes.
