## Introduction

This document outlines guidelines for implementing incremental addons to the Oxy Journey game. The approach focuses on breaking down feature implementations into small, testable units that build upon each other, ensuring that each step has a clear deliverable and validation criteria before moving to the next.

## Incremental Development Principles

1. **Vertical Slices**: Implement thin end-to-end slices of functionality first, before expanding with additional features.
2. **UI-First Approach**: Begin with visual/UI components before implementing complex logic.
3. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementation when appropriate.
4. **Staged Deployment**: Deploy and validate each increment before proceeding to the next.
5. **Documentation First**: Update relevant documentation before starting implementation.

## Standard Incremental Implementation Process

### 1. Planning Phase
- **Document the Feature**: Create a detailed description in `tasks/current_tasks.md`
- **Break Down Steps**: Divide the feature into granular, sequential steps
- **Set Success Criteria**: Define what "done" looks like for each step
- **Assess Dependencies**: Identify any dependencies on other components

### 2. Implementation Phase
Follow this sequence for each feature:

#### Step 1: Visual Prototype
- Implement the UI/visual components first
- Focus on appearance and positioning
- Use stub data and mock functions
- Validate appearance matches design requirements

#### Step 2: Interaction Layer
- Add user interaction capabilities
- Implement event handlers
- Connect visual feedback mechanisms
- Ensure smooth user experience

#### Step 3: Logic Implementation
- Add business logic and game mechanics
- Implement state management
- Connect to existing systems
- Add error handling and edge cases

#### Step 4: Testing & Validation
- Add unit tests for core functionality
- Add integration tests for component interactions
- Perform visual verification
- Check against success criteria

#### Step 5: Refinement & Documentation
- Optimize performance if needed
- Refactor and clean up code
- Update documentation
- Add comments for complex logic

## Examples of Incremental Addon Implementation

### Example 1: Lives Mechanism

#### Incremental Steps:
1. **UI Implementation**
   - Create a `LivesDisplay` component with heart icons
   - Add placeholder for 3 lives in the HUD
   - Verify visual presentation
   - Test rendering with different life values

2. **Animation and Feedback**
   - Add transition animations for losing a life
   - Implement visual feedback (screen flash, heart animation)
   - Test visual feedback in isolation

3. **State Management**
   - Connect `LivesDisplay` to the game state
   - Implement `loseLife` method in `GameStateContext`
   - Add game over detection
   - Test state changes and transitions

4. **Integration**
   - Connect collision detection to life loss
   - Implement game over screen
   - Add restart functionality
   - Perform full integration testing

### Example 2: Question and Answer System

#### Incremental Steps:
1. **UI Components**
   - Create `QuestionModal` component
   - Design answer buttons/input mechanism
   - Implement layout and styling
   - Test rendering with various question types

2. **Interaction and Animation**
   - Add modal open/close animations
   - Implement answer selection
   - Add visual feedback for correct/incorrect answers
   - Test user interactions in isolation

3. **Questions Database**
   - Create a structured questions repository
   - Implement question selection mechanism
   - Add difficulty progression
   - Test question retrieval and validation

4. **Game Logic Integration**
   - Connect collision events to question display
   - Link answer outcomes to lives/score
   - Add progress tracking
   - Implement difficulty adjustment
   - Test full question flow

5. **Educational Validation**
   - Review questions for educational accuracy
   - Test with target age group if possible
   - Refine based on feedback

## Guidelines for Specific Feature Types

### Visual Effects
1. Start with static visual implementation
2. Add basic animation
3. Add advanced effects and particles
4. Link to game events
5. Optimize for performance

### Audio Features
1. Add audio assets and implement basic playback
2. Create sound manager for controlled playback
3. Add spatial audio if needed
4. Connect to game events
5. Add settings for volume control

### Performance Improvements
1. Measure current performance as baseline
2. Implement proposed improvements
3. Measure impact and validate improvements
4. Refine based on benchmarks
5. Document optimization techniques

## Documentation Requirements

For each incremental addon:
1. Update the `current_tasks.md` with implementation steps
2. Document the implementation approach in `session_log.md`
3. Add comments to code explaining complex logic or decisions
4. Update technical documentation if architectural changes are made
5. Add testing instructions if special steps are required

## Conclusion

By following these incremental addon implementation guidelines, we ensure:
1. Each feature is built on solid foundations
2. Progress is visible and measurable
3. Issues are identified early when they're easier to fix
4. The codebase remains stable throughout development
5. Features are thoroughly tested before release
