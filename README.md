# Oxy Journey (Vibe Coding Infrastructure PoC)

## üöÄ Overview

"Oxy Journey" is a 3D educational game designed for 6th-grade level students to learn about the human respiratory system. Players navigate as "Oxy" through a single level, avoiding germs and dust. Upon collision, a question related to the respiratory system appears. Correctly answering allows Oxy to maintain health, while incorrect answers result in losing a life.

This game project serves as the primary **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for developing, testing, and refining the **Vibe Coding Infrastructure**. The goal is to build this game from scratch using the Vibe Coding methodologies to validate their effectiveness for solo, AI-augmented product development.

## ‚ú® Core Goals

-   **Goal 1 (Infrastructure Validation):** To implement and validate all components of the Vibe Coding Infrastructure (templates, protocols, AI configurations) through the development of "Oxy Journey."
-   **Goal 2 (Process Refinement):** To identify and refine best practices for solo, AI-augmented development, specifically focusing on context management, incremental building, session resumption, and efficient AI collaboration while building a functional game.
-   **Goal 3 (Product Delivery PoC):** To develop a complete and functional single-level 3D educational game ("Oxy Journey") that includes core gameplay (navigation, collision, Q&A mechanics with varied question types - e.g., yes/no, multiple choice), and delivers on its educational premise for the respiratory system.

## STATUS

**Current Status:** PoC - Active Development (Focus: Infrastructure Setup & Component Migration)
**Last Updated:** 2024-03-19

## üìù Notes for AI Assistant

-   When referencing project goals, always consult `docs_ai/01_project_brief.md`. Note the dual focus: validating the Vibe Coding Infrastructure *through* the successful development of the "Oxy Journey" game.
-   For architectural questions related to the *game concept*, see `docs_ai/02_architecture_overview.md`. 
-   The educational content should be appropriate for a 6th-grade level, focusing on the respiratory system.
-   Q&A mechanics will involve 2D UI overlays and should support various question formats (yes/no, multiple choice, etc.).
-   My current focus can usually be found in `tasks/current_tasks.md` and the latest entries in `docs_ai/session_log.md`. This will often relate to building specific game features or testing a part of the Vibe Coding Infrastructure.
