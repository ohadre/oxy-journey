# Oxy Journey (Vibe Coding Infrastructure PoC)

## 🚀 Overview

"Oxy Journey" is a 3D educational game for 6th-grade students to learn the human respiratory system. Players navigate as "Oxy" through a single level, avoiding germs and dust. Collisions trigger questions about the respiratory system. Correct answers keep Oxy healthy; incorrect ones cost lives.

This project validates the **Vibe Coding Infrastructure** for AI-augmented development while delivering a functional game.

## ✨ Core Goals

- **Infrastructure Validation:** Implement and test all components of the Vibe Coding Infrastructure.
- **Process Refinement:** Identify best practices for solo, AI‑assisted development.
- **Product Delivery PoC:** Build a complete single-level game with Q&A mechanics.

## STATUS

**Current Status:** PoC - Active Development
