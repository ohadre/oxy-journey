# Oxy Journey (Vibe Coding Infrastructure PoC)

## üöÄ Overview

"Oxy Journey" is a 3D educational game designed for 6th-grade level students to learn about the human respiratory system. Players navigate as "Oxy" through a single level, avoiding germs and dust. Upon collision, a question related to the respiratory system appears. Correctly answering allows Oxy to maintain health, while incorrect answers result in losing a life.

This game project serves as the primary **Proof of Concept (PoC)** for developing, testing, and refining the **Vibe Coding Infrastructure**. The goal is to build this game from scratch using the Vibe Coding methodologies to validate their effectiveness for solo, AI-augmented product development.

## ‚ú® Core Goals

-   **Goal 1 (Infrastructure Validation):** To implement and validate all components of the Vibe Coding Infrastructure (templates, protocols, AI configurations) through the development of "Oxy Journey."
-   **Goal 2 (Process Refinement):** To identify and refine best practices for solo, AI-augmented development, specifically focusing on context management, incremental building, session resumption, and efficient AI collaboration while building a functional game.
-   **Goal 3 (Product Delivery PoC):** To develop a complete and functional single-level 3D educational game ("Oxy Journey") that includes core gameplay (navigation, collision, Q&A mechanics with varied question types - e.g., yes/no, multiple choice), and delivers on its educational premise for the respiratory system.

## STATUS

**Current Status:** PoC - Active Development (Focus: Game Experience & Loading Improvements)
**Last Updated:** 2025-05-11

## Recent Improvements

- **Question Image Support (YYYY-MM-DD Current Date):**
    - Enhanced the Q&A system to allow optional images to be displayed alongside questions in the `QuestionModal`.
    - Updated data structures, services, and UI components to support this feature.
    - Added an example image for a question about the diaphragm.

- **Home Page Redesign & Theming (YYYY-MM-DD Current Date):**
    - Implemented a new v0 visual design for the home page (`src/app/page.tsx`) featuring updated fonts, animations with Framer Motion, and character elements.
    - Established a new Shadcn/ui-based theming system using CSS variables and `next-themes` for light/dark mode capabilities.
    - Updated Tailwind CSS configuration (`tailwind.config.ts`, `globals.css`) to support the new theme.
    - Preserved existing language selection functionality (English/Hebrew) with dynamic title updates.
    - Resolved various technical issues including dependency management, Tailwind configuration, image path errors, and React hydration mismatches.
- **Entity & Collision System Refactor (June 2024):**
    - Refactored `GermManager` and `DustManager` to separate entity logic (movement, spawning, filtering) from rendering, improving state management and component responsibility.
    - Introduced dedicated visual components (`Germ`, `DustParticle`) for rendering entities based on state managed in `Scene3D`.
    - Implemented robust collision detection in `CollisionManager` for both Germs and Dust, triggering updates to a new `lives` state in `Scene3D`.
    - Tuned spawning parameters (`MAX_GERMS`, `MAX_DUST`, spawn intervals, speed, lifetime) for continuous gameplay flow.
    - Updated `LivesIndicator` to display current player lives based on collisions.
    - Resolved associated bugs (movement snapping, build errors).
- **May 2025 Refactor & Bugfix Cycle:**
    - Refactored `GermManager` and `DustManager` to use a new shared `EntityManager` base class, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.
    - Improved `LoadingManager` with robust error handling and resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks.
    - Fixed tunnel rendering by correcting the texture path and improving resource management in the `Tunnel` component.
    - Cleaned up debug code and improved error handling in `Scene3D`, `Oxy`, and `CameraController` components.
    - Enhanced overall code quality, performance, and maintainability across core game systems.
- **Custom Tunnel Environment**: Implemented a visually immersive tunnel with animated textures, simulating movement through the respiratory system.
- **Oxy Character**: Added visual representation of Oxy with proper movement constraints within the tunnel.
- **Enemy System**: Implemented germs that spawn and navigate toward the player with fluid movement.
- **Comprehensive Loading System**: Added a robust asset preloading system with visual progress feedback to prevent white flashes during transitions.
- **Deployment & Infrastructure**: Consolidated Vercel deployment pipeline for streamlined continuous deployment.
- **Game Win Condition & Modal**: Implemented a full win condition (reach tunnel end + minimum unique correct answers + lives > 0). A "You Won!" modal (`WinModal.tsx`) now appears with the player's score (time, questions answered, lives remaining) and offers a restart option. This modal supports English and Hebrew.
- **Question Image Support**: Added the ability to include images with questions. The `QuestionModal.tsx` now displays these images, using the question topic as alt text. Images are stored in `public/images/questions/`.
- **Home Page Redesign (v0)**: Successfully implemented a new home page design based on user-provided v0 code. This involved updating `tailwind.config.ts`, `globals.css`, `layout.tsx`, and `page.tsx`, creating a `ThemeProvider`, and debugging issues related to `next-themes`, CSS paths, Tailwind configuration, and image paths. The page now features a responsive background, dark/light mode toggle (via `ThemeProvider`), and language selection (English/Hebrew) with a localized title.

## üìù Notes for AI Assistant

-   When referencing project goals, always consult `docs_ai/01_project_brief.md`. Note the dual focus: validating the Vibe Coding Infrastructure *through* the successful development of the "Oxy Journey" game.
-   For architectural questions related to the *game concept*, see `docs_ai/02_architecture_overview.md`. 
-   The educational content should be appropriate for a 6th-grade level, focusing on the respiratory system.
-   Q&A mechanics will involve 2D UI overlays and should support various question formats (yes/no, multiple choice, etc.).
-   My current focus can usually be found in `tasks/current_tasks.md` and the latest entries in `docs_ai/session_log.md`. This will often relate to building specific game features or testing a part of the Vibe Coding Infrastructure.
